# Task 2 – Text Cleaning, Keyword Extraction, and Summarization

## Overview
In Task 2, the extracted resume text from Task 1 was cleaned and processed to remove noise, standardize formatting, and prepare data for AI-based analysis.  
Keywords were generated from the cleaned text to identify the candidate’s core skills. A refined and more professional summary was also created.

## Files Included
- **cleaned_text.txt** – Cleaned and formatted version of the extracted resume text.
- **keywords.txt** – List of important keywords extracted from the cleaned text.
- **summary.txt** – Final optimized professional summary based on the resume.
- **output/** – Folder reserved for exporting JSON/text results in future tasks.

## Steps Performed
1. Removed unwanted symbols, extra spaces, and formatting issues.
2. Standardized headings and converted text to clean readable form.
3. Identified keywords such as skills, technologies, and project-related terms.
4. Created a strong professional summary describing experience and skills.

## Output
This cleaned and processed data will be used in further tasks (Task 3 & Task 4) for UI integration and backend processing.
