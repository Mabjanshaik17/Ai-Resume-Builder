# Task 1 – Resume Collection & Text Extraction

## Overview
The purpose of Task 1 is to collect a sample resume, store it in a structured format, and extract textual information from it. This extracted text will be used in the later tasks for cleaning, keyword extraction, and AI-powered summarization.

## Files Included
- **resume.pdf** – The original resume provided by the user.
- **extracted_text.txt** – The raw text extracted from the resume.
- **summary.txt** – Short summary generated from the extracted text.
- **images/** – Optional folder for storing images extracted from the resume (if needed).

## Steps Performed
1. A resume (PDF) was collected and added to the folder.
2. Text was extracted from the PDF using a Python script / OCR tool.
3. The extracted text was saved in `extracted_text.txt`.
4. A short summary was generated and saved in `summary.txt`.
5. Files were organized neatly for further processing in Task 2.

## Output
This task provides the base input for the entire project.  
The next task uses this extracted text for cleaning and keyword generation.
